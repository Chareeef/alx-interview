# Prime Game 🎉

## Embarking on an Exciting Journey! 🚀🔍

Welcome to my exhilarating journey through the "Prime Game" project! 🚀 This electrifying challenge is all about unleashing my dynamic programming prowess and showcasing my problem-solving skills in preparation for those thrilling software engineering interviews. Let's dive in and embark on this exciting coding adventure! 💻✨

## Let's Crack the Code! 🧠💥

My goal, and I'm absolutely thrilled to take it on, is to implement the `isWinner` function. This function is the key to determining the champion of each round in this thrilling showdown. With my enthusiasm and determination, I'm ready to analyze each round, calculate the optimal moves for Maria and Ben, and declare the ultimate victor! 🥇✨

## How Does It Work? 🤔🔄

The `isWinner` function takes in the number of rounds (`x`) and an array of values representing the upper limit (`nums`) for each round. It's my job to dive deep into the code, unleash my coding superpowers, and determine the champion of each round! 💪🏽💥

## Test Example and Output 🚀📋

To illustrate how the `isWinner` function works, let's consider an example:
```
x = 3, nums = [4, 5, 1]
```
1. **First Round (n = 4):**
   - Maria selects 2 and removes 2 and its multiples, leaving 1 and 3.
   - Ben selects 3 and removes it, leaving 1.
   - Ben wins because there are no prime numbers left for Maria to choose.
2. **Second Round (n = 5):**
   - Maria selects 2 and removes 2 and its multiples, leaving 1, 3, and 5.
   - Ben selects 3 and removes 3, leaving 1 and 5.
   - Maria selects 5 and removes it, leaving 1.
   - Maria wins because there are no prime numbers left for Ben to choose.
3. **Third Round (n = 1):**
   - Ben wins because there are no prime numbers left for Maria to choose.

Hence, the winner of this example is Ben.

## Get Ready to Rumble! 💥🥊

I'm absolutely pumped to embark on this exhilarating journey of dynamic programming and strategic thinking! Armed with my coding skills and boundless enthusiasm, I'm destined to conquer the "Prime Game" and emerge victorious! Let the coding battle begin! 🏋️‍♂️💥
