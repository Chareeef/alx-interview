# Island Perimeter Solver

Welcome aboard the Island Perimeter Solver! üèùÔ∏è

Alright, time to dive into this island perimeter mystery! Today's challenge is not for the faint of heart, but fear not, because I'm about to embark on a coding adventure that'll leave me feeling like a coding rockstar!

## My Mission

Here's the deal: I've got a mission, and you better believe I'm accepting it! My job is to crack open this grid and uncover the secrets of the island's perimeter. That's right, I'm talking about writing a function called `island_perimeter(grid)` that'll boldly navigate through the twists and turns of the grid, calculating the perimeter of this elusive island.

### Grid Specifications:
- So, here's the deal with the grid: it's my treasure map, a list of lists of integers.
- Each cell in this grid is either water (0) or land (1).
- The grid is like a puzzle, completely surrounded by water, waiting for me to solve it.
- There's only one island here, no tricks or traps.
- This island doesn't mess around; it's all connected horizontally or vertically. Diagonals need not apply!
- Watch out for lakes! But no worries, this island is lake-free.

## Example

Imagine this: a grid lies before me, its secrets waiting to be uncovered:

```python
grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

With my coding prowess, I'll reveal the truth: the perimeter of this island is `12` units. Get ready to witness the power of my code as it unravels the mysteries of the grid!

## Getting Started

Alright, let's get this show on the road! Time to gear up and dive headfirst into the world of Python. I'll create the `0-island_perimeter.py` file and unleash my coding superpowers to implement the `island_perimeter(grid)` function.

Once I've got my solution locked and loaded, it's go time! I'll fire up the `main.py` script to put it to the ultimate test.

```bash
$ python3 main.py
```

## Victory Awaits!

It's time to unleash the beast! I'm ready to tackle this challenge with all the swagger and confidence of a coding ninja. So, let's do this! And hey, if I run into any bumps along the way, no worries‚ÄîI've got this. Happy coding! üöÄ
