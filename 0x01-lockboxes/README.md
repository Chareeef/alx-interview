# Lockboxes Problem

Welcome to the README for the Lockboxes problem! In this README, we'll delve into the problem, its requirements, and how we can tackle it.

## What's the Lockboxes Problem?

Imagine we have a number of locked boxes placed in front of us, each box numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1. These boxes may contain keys to other boxes. Our goal is to write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened, starting with the first box which is already unlocked.

## Problem Prototype:

```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    # Implementation goes here
```

### Inputs:

- `boxes`: A list of lists representing the boxes and their contents.

### Assumptions:

- Each box may contain keys to other boxes.
- A key with the same number as a box opens that box.
- All keys will be positive integers.
- There can be keys that do not have corresponding boxes.
- The first box `boxes[0]` is already unlocked.

### Output:

- Return `True` if all boxes can be opened, else return `False`.

## Examples:

Let's explore a few examples to understand the problem better:

1. In the example `[[1], [2], [3], [4], []]`, all boxes can be opened because every box has a key to the next one. So, the expected output is `True`.

2. For `[[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]`, we can navigate through the boxes and unlock all of them. Hence, the expected output is `True`.

3. However, in the last example `[[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]`, we cannot unlock all boxes since there's no available key to box 3 (except the one in box 3 itself which is obviously closed). Therefore, the expected output is `False`.

## Conclusion:

That's the Lockboxes problem in a nutshell! By implementing the `canUnlockAll` method, we'll delve deeper into understanding algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. So, let's dive in, give it a try, and happy coding! ðŸš€
