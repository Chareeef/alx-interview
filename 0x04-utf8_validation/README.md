## UTF-8 Validation Problem

In computer science, UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding capable of encoding all valid Unicode code points. It is backward compatible with ASCII and designed to be efficient for Unicode. In this problem, we are tasked with validating whether a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

### Rules for UTF-8 Encoding

1. **Character Length**: A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long. The length of the character is determined by the most significant bits (MSBs) in the first byte.

2. **Byte Representation**: Each character's byte representation starts with a prefix that indicates the number of bytes that follow. The following are the binary representations for each length:

   - For a 1-byte character: `0xxxxxxx`
   - For a 2-byte character: `110xxxxx 10xxxxxx`
   - For a 3-byte character: `1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx`
   - For a 4-byte character: `11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx`

3. **Data Format**: The data set is represented by a list of integers, where each integer represents 1 byte of data. Therefore, we only need to consider the 8 least significant bits of each integer.

### Problem Statement

Write a method `validUTF8(data)` that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. The function should return `True` if the data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, and `False` otherwise.

### Prototype

```python
def validUTF8(data: List[int]) -> bool:
```

### Sample Input and Output

```python
data = [65]
print(validUTF8(data))  # Output: True

data = [80, 121, 116, 104, 111, 110, 32, 105, 115, 32, 99, 111, 111, 108, 33]
print(validUTF8(data))  # Output: True

data = [229, 65, 127, 256]
print(validUTF8(data))  # Output: False
```

### Explanation

- In the first example, the data contains a single byte representing the ASCII character 'A', which is a valid UTF-8 encoding.
- In the second example, the data represents the string "Python is cool!", which is a valid UTF-8 encoding.
- In the third example, the data set contains the integers `[229, 65, 127, 256]`. Let's break down each integer:

1. `229`: This integer represents the byte `11100101` in binary. According to the UTF-8 encoding rules, the most significant bits (`111`) indicate that it's the start of a 3-byte character. However, the following bytes (`65`, `127`, and `256`) do not form a valid continuation of a 3-byte character, violating the UTF-8 encoding rules.

2. `65`, `127`, and `256`: These integers do not represent valid UTF-8 encoded characters. Specifically, `256` is outside the valid range of 0-255 for byte values.

Therefore, the data set does not represent a valid UTF-8 encoding, resulting in the function returning `False`.

By following the rules outlined above, the function `validUTF8()` can determine the validity of UTF-8 encoded data sets, assisting in various text processing and data validation tasks.
