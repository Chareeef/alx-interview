# Minimum Operations Problem

## Problem Description:

The Minimum Operations problem involves determining the fewest number of operations required to achieve a specific configuration of characters in a text file. In this particular scenario, the text file initially contains a single character 'H', and the only operations allowed are "Copy All" and "Paste". The goal is to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` occurrences of the character 'H' in the file.

### Example:

For example, given `n = 9`, the initial state is 'H'. The following sequence of operations achieves the desired configuration:
1. Copy All
2. Paste (resulting in 'HH')
3. Paste (resulting in 'HHH')
4. Copy All
5. Paste (resulting in 'HHHHHH')
6. Paste (resulting in 'HHHHHHHHH')

Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 6.

## Method Signature:

```python
def minOperations(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

    Args:
        n (int): The desired number of H characters in the file.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of operations required. If n is impossible to achieve, return 0.
    """
```
