# Star Wars Movie Character Printer

Hey there! So, I've got this cool task where I need to write a script in JavaScript that fetches and prints all the characters from a specific Star Wars movie using the Star Wars API.

## Usage

To run our script, we just need to fire up our terminal and type:

```
node starwars_characters.js <Movie_ID>
```

Replace `<Movie_ID>` with the ID of the Star Wars movie we're interested in. For example:

```
node starwars_characters.js 3
```

## Output Example

Here's what we'll get when we run the script with a movie ID:

```
Luke Skywalker
C-3PO
R2-D2
Darth Vader
Leia Organa
Obi-Wan Kenobi
Chewbacca
Han Solo
Jabba Desilijic Tiure
Wedge Antilles
Yoda
Palpatine
Boba Fett
Lando Calrissian
Ackbar
Mon Mothma
Arvel Crynyd
Wicket Systri Warrick
Nien Nunb
Bib Fortuna
```

## Knowledge Needed

To tackle this task, we'll need:

- Understanding of JavaScript asynchronous programming
- Knowledge of making HTTP requests in JavaScript
- Familiarity with the `request` module or similar libraries
- Basic understanding of JSON data handling

So, wanna join me on this adventure into the Star Wars universe? It's gonna be a blast! 😁💫
